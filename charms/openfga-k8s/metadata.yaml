  A high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine 
  built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar.

  OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for developers to model 
  their application permissions and add and integrate fine-grained
  authorization into their applications.

  It allows in-memory data storage for quick development, as well 
  as pluggable database modules. It currently supports PostgreSQL
  and MySQL.

  It offers an HTTP API and a gRPC API. It has SDKs for 
  Node.js/JavaScript, GoLang, Python and .NET. Look in our
  Community section for third-party SDKs and tools.
